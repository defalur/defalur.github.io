# About me

Hi! My name is Cl√©ment and I'm a software engineer who likes exploring various
topics, especially in image processing, 3D rendering and video games. I made
this blog in order to have a place where I could document my discoveries
and thoughts.

# This site was made using Jekyll and GitHub pages.
