# My journey begins here
Every journey needs to start somewhere. My programming journey started about 10 years ago when I asked one of my teacher if programming
was needed to make robot, and his answer was "Of course! It's essential!". And not really knowing why he said that, I started learning programming
through tutorials on the internet. And soon enough I would find myself wanting to create something significant, and being an avid gamer at the
time, I wanted to create a game. This game should be something I would love to play, which at the time would be Minecraft with industry mods.
I spent a few months learning C++, and then the SDL for 2D graphics and then I was ready to make my dream game! I started writing code without
a plan, implemented a really bad map generation algorithm which I was really proud of but didn't really understand, I added movement, sprite animations,
collisions, and even destructible blocks! And then I decided to add an inventory, which took a long time. At this point on my first project, I had written
maybe around 1000 lines of code and I was starting to struggle with pretty much everything. I refactored the menus to make them easier to create, and then nothing.
I had lost my will to work on that game after around a year and realizing that I was probably too ambitious.

After that project I realized that I had grown as a programmer. I went from pretty much zero to a little above zero, and with these new skills, I was determined to make something
great once again! I wanted to tell stories, and I had heard about text based RPGs of the past, and without knowing a single thing about them I decided to try making one.
Surely this project would be different, and easier because I don't need to draw things, only write. This project also lasted a year before losing interest and giving up.
Once again I realized that I had progressed. A few years went by with a few similar projects, this time with 2D graphics.

When entering college, I realized that I had a lot to learn, which I did, these were 5 difficult years but I grew a lot from them, both as a person and a programmer.
I discovered the Unity engine and made a few relatively finished games with it, all for school projects, while my personal projects usually were rare and almost never finished.

# A fresh start
Now that college is almost over, I think it's a great opportunity to start anew. I want to create something more than ever, and this time I want to see the end of my next
project. I now know that scope is an important part of what I need to think about, and that project management is also a good idea.
For the scope, I know that I should keep it small and very precise, with only a very small number of core mechanics.

With that in mind, it was time to find ideas of games I could make. I spent some time in the past writing ideas I had for games in a text file buried inside a hard drive
but all of these ideas were very ambitious and would need years of development with a reasonably big team of experienced people and I'm on my own, with maybe the help of an
artist and another developer. Finding a simple concept that can work on its own is a difficult task. You could have an idea, prototype it, find that it has potential but
struggle to use all that potential. I'm not a game designer after all, only a programmer with some interest in game design.
I also had great ideas of simple multiplayer games but I'm not experienced enough to make a game with a network protocol yet (or at least a
good network protocol). This game needs to revolve around a single core mechanic, it also needs to be single player and not need an AI that's too advanced.
I had a few ideas for puzzle games which could work, but I know nothing about puzzle games and I couldn't find how to make the prototype fun.

# Sails In The Wind
I've had an idea for a while, about a game set in space, in which the player would build a network of ships and other crazy space machines to transport goods, a little bit like
Transport Tycoon, but in space. This is not what I decided to make, because I felt that the scope was too large, but I liked the idea of traveling to unknown places and potentially
transporting things, a bit like *Endless Space* (try it, it's free!). Also I wanted to make the act of moving around interesting and settled for a top down 2D sailing simulation.
The player would have to
adapt to the direction of the wind to travel, like the old explorers when traveling around the world on magnificent sailing ships. I think this base mechanic should work and my
prototype is showing some potential. I now have to design everything else to hopefully finally make a complete game, this is the hard part.

# Onwards!
This is the start of my journey, and this site will help me record each step along the way. This will be a record of my progress, and maybe a story worth telling. I'm going
to develop *Sails In The Wind* and write about my progress here.
